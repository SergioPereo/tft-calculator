This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What it is

This is a TFT unit calculator for the set 10 inspired by the calculator made by [wongkj12](https://github.com/wongkj12/TFT-Rolling-Odds-Calculator). The first page is kinda the same as wongkj12 development. But it has a different mathematical approach to it. I'm planning on making more tools refering to this but as for now I just have a calculator that tells you the probability of seeing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of your desired units on a rolldown.

## Tool

You can take a look at the tool [here](https://tft-calculator-sergiopereos-projects.vercel.app/).
